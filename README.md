# **SIEM Implementation and Log Analysis with Splunk on a Home Network**

## **Introduction**
Implement a SIEM system using Splunk to collect, analyze, and correlate security logs from devices on your home network.

## **Objectives**
- Gain hands-on experience in setting up and managing a SIEM system.
- Collect and analyze logs from various home network devices.
- Create security alerts and generate reports.

## **Skills Learned**
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

## **Steps**

### **1. Download and Install Splunk**
1. **Download Splunk** from [Splunk's official website](https://www.splunk.com/).

2. **Install Splunk** on your machine.
   - For Windows: Double-click the installer and follow the prompts.
   - For Linux: Use the terminal to install using the appropriate package manager.

### **2. Start Splunk and Create an Account**
1. **Start Splunk**:
   - Windows: Launch Splunk from the Start menu.
   - Linux: Use the command `sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start`.

2. **Create an Admin Account**:
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
   - Follow the prompts to create an admin account.

### **3. Configuring Data Inputs**
1. **Identify Log Sources**:
   - Determine which devices on your home network will provide logs (e.g., computers, routers, smart devices).

2. **Enable Logging on Devices**:
   - Configure your devices to generate and send logs to your Splunk instance.
   - For Windows PCs, enable Windows Event Logs.
   - For routers, enable syslog and point it to your Splunk server's IP.

3. **Add Data Sources**:
   - Navigate to `Settings > Data Inputs`.
   - Choose the type of data input (e.g., Files & Directories for local logs, TCP/UDP for syslog).

### **4. Creating and Managing Indexes**
1. **Create an Index**:
   - Navigate to `Settings > Indexes`.
   - Click on `New Index` and configure settings as needed.

### **5. Search and Investigate Logs**
1. **Perform a Basic Search**:
   - Go to `Apps > Search & Reporting`.
   - Use the search bar to query logs. Example: `index=your_index_name`.

2. **Create Alerts**:
   - From the search results, click `Save As > Alert`.
   - Configure the alert conditions and actions.

### **6. Dashboards and Reports**
1. **Create a Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to `Apps > Search & Reporting > Dashboards`.
   - Click `Create New Dashboard` and add search results, charts, and visualizations.

2. **Generate Reports**:
   - Go to `Reports` and click `Create New Report`.
   - Configure the report settings and save it.

### **7. Advanced Analysis**
1. **Create Correlation Searches**:
   - Navigate to `Settings > Content > Correlation Searches`.
   - Create a new correlation search to detect complex security events.

2. **Install Machine Learning Toolkit**:
   - Go to `Apps > Find More Apps` and search for the Machine Learning Toolkit.
   - Install and configure it for advanced analytics.

### **8. Maintaining and Troubleshooting**
1. **Monitor System Health**:
   - Use Splunkâ€™s monitoring console to check the health of your deployment.

2. **Backup and Restore**:
   - Regularly back up your Splunk configuration and data.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the implementation of a SIEM system using Splunk on a home network. It covers setting up data inputs, creating alerts, and generating reports for log analysis.
